## 📡 Automatic Log Routing

| OS      | Log directory        |
|---------|----------------------|
| macOS   | `logs/mac/`          |
| Fedora  | `logs/fedora/`       |
| Ubuntu  | `logs/ubuntu/`       |

- Controlled by `scripts/maintenance/auto_route.sh`.
- Ensure `LOG_PATH` aligns with the active environment before running scripts.

🧙‍♂️ One repo to rule them all...

One repo to rule them all,
One pipeline to find them,
One YAML to build them all,
And in production bind them.
In the land of CI/CD where the logs lie deep.

(– S-Ebadi, keeper of the main branch)
